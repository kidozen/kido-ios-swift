Kidozen's BETA-SDK Swift implementation. For now, we are using a sample application with Kidozen classes in it, as it's not currently possible to create a framework out of this, due to the beta state of the language.

In order to start working on this, you should open the SampleSDKSwift.xcworkspace file with XCode 6 Beta 7

All Kidozen's classes are located in the SampleSDKSwift/kidoSDKSwift directory. If you want to add more KZ Classes, please add them there, as in the future we are going to extract that directory and convert everything KZ related to a library.

AFNetworking has been installed as a POD, which is the recommended method.

Please keep in mind that this is an early BETA release, it's not production ready.
